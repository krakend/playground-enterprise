## Endpoint
```http
/git/{user}
```

## How aggregation works
When a user calls `/git/{user}`, KrakenD connects in parallel to the two `backend` objects defined, which are:

1. `https://api.github.com/users/{user}`
2. `https://api.github.com/users/{user}/repos`

The first backend returns information about the `{user}`, and the second their associated repositories. The information of the two backends is merged into a single response.

## Basic manipulation
In addition, the first backend only takes a few properties from the response, and the rest are discarded, thanks to the `allow` manipulation. It also renames the field `blog` to `website`, and finally puts the whole response under a new object `user`, thanks to the `group` modifier.

The second backend does not return an object, but an array, so we tell KrakenD that this is a collection of elements.
